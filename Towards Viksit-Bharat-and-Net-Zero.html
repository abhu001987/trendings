    <h1>Scenarios Towards Viksit Bharat and Net Zero</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">

<h2>Why in News?</h2>

<p>
NITI Aayog has released a comprehensive set of 11 reports focusing on "Scenarios Towards Viksit Bharat and Net Zero," developed by ten Inter-Ministerial Working Groups.
</p>

<p>
These reports provide an integrated assessment of how India can achieve the ambitious vision of becoming a Viksit Bharat (Developed Nation) by 2047 with a GDP of USD 30 trillion, while simultaneously honoring its commitment to achieve Net Zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2070.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
NITI Aayog’s reports outline how India can become a USD 30 trillion economy by 2047 while achieving Net Zero by 2070 through electrification, massive renewable and nuclear expansion, green jobs, and sustainable urbanization.
</p>

<p>
The transition faces hurdles like financing gaps, critical mineral dependence, technology limits, and just transition needs; solutions include climate finance reforms, green industrial policies, resilient supply chains, sustainable infrastructure, and Mission LiFE–driven behavioral change.
</p>

<h2>What are the Key Highlights of NITI Aayog Reports on "Scenarios Towards Viksit Bharat and Net Zero"?</h2>

<h3>Macroeconomic and Social Impacts</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>GDP Structure:</b> The economy will shift from "Consumption-Led" to "Investment-Driven." Private consumption share will drop, while investment share will rise.</li>

<li>GDP is projected to rise from USD 4.18 trillion (2025) to USD 30 trillion (2047).</li>

<li><b>Trade Balance:</b> While critical mineral imports will rise, fossil fuel import savings are estimated at INR 9 trillion by 2070, strengthening economic resilience.</li>

<li><b>Employment:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Green Jobs: The energy sector will add 7 million jobs by 2050.</li>
<li>Just Transition: Fossil-fuel dependent districts (over 150) will face restructuring, requiring massive skilling and social protection for workers.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Land Conflict:</b> Renewable energy expansion requires vast land, potentially competing with agriculture and ecology.</li>

<li><b>Role of Behavior:</b> Initiatives like Mission LiFE are critical to moderate demand through lifestyle changes (e.g., public transport, efficient cooling).</li>

<li><b>Urbanization:</b> The urban population will swell from 37% in 2023 to 51% by 2047 and 65% by 2070.</li>

<li><b>Infrastructure Boom:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Housing: 86% of the building floor space required by 2070 is yet to be built.</li>
<li>Cooling: Air Conditioner (AC) penetration is projected to rise from 10% today to 80% by 2070, significantly increasing energy demand.</li>
<li>Vehicle Ownership: Car ownership per 1,000 people will jump from 32 to 200-250 by 2070.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Energy Transition under the Net Zero Scenario</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Electrification is Key:</b> Electricity’s share in final energy demand will triple, rising from 21% (2025) to 60% (2070) under the Net Zero Scenario.</li>

<li><b>Drivers:</b> Electric Vehicles (EVs), induction cooking, and industrial heat pumps.</li>

<li><b>Shift in Power Generation:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Renewables: Solar and Wind capacity will scale massively from ~164 GW (2025) to over 6,000 GW (2070).</li>
<li>Nuclear Energy: Envisioned as a strategic pillar, scaling from 8 GW to over 300 GW by 2070 to provide firm, baseload power.</li>
<li>Fossil Fuels: The share of fossil fuels in the primary energy mix will drop from 87% (2025) to 14% (2070).</li>
<li>Remaining fossil fuel usage will rely on Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS).</li>
<li>Grid Emissions: The grid emission factor is projected to drop to zero by 2070.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Financial Implications and Investment Gaps</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Investment Requirement:</b> The Net Zero Scenario requires a cumulative investment of USD 22.7 trillion by 2070.</li>

<li>This translates to USD 500 billion per year, compared to the current annual investment of USD 135 billion.</li>

<li><b>Financing Gap:</b> Even with domestic reforms, a financing gap of USD 6.5 trillion remains.</li>

<li><b>Reliance on Foreign Capital:</b> To bridge this gap, the share of international capital sources (FDI, concessional finance) may need to rise from 17% to 42% by 2070.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Critical Minerals</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Demand Surge:</b> The transition from fossil fuels to clean technologies moves energy security risks from "fuel supply" to "mineral supply."</li>

<li>Demand for Critical Energy Transition Minerals (CETMs) will increase by 51% in the Net Zero Scenario compared to current policies.</li>

<li><b>Key Minerals:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Copper & Graphite: Account for two-thirds of demand.</li>
<li>Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel: India faces near-total import dependence for these.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Sectors Driving Demand:</b> EV Batteries (55% of demand) and Solar Technologies (30%).</li>

<li><b>Strategy:</b> India needs to enhance exploration, secure international assets, and promote circularity (recycling).</li>

</ul>

<h2>What are India's Challenges in Achieving Viksit Bharat and Net Zero?</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>The "Unprecedented Experiment" of Scale:</b> The NITI Aayog notes that no major economy has ever attempted to scale its GDP eightfold (from ~USD 4.18 trillion to USD 30 trillion) within a single generation while simultaneously transforming its energy system to Net Zero.</li>

<li><b>Nascent Technology:</b> Key technologies required for this transition specifically CCUS, Long-duration Energy Storage, and Small Modular Nuclear Reactors remain "nascent and unproven at scale in India."</li>

<li><b>The Financing Gap & Macroeconomic Shift:</b> The transition demands a structural shift where the share of Private Consumption in GDP drops (from 58% in 2025 to 52% in 2070), while Investment share rises.</li>

<li>This implies a "tightening of domestic liquidity" that could crowd out consumption if not balanced by foreign inflows.</li>

<li><b>Critical Mineral Security:</b> For Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, and Rare Earth Elements, India faces near-total dependence on imports due to a lack of domestic reserves.</li>

<li>Even where raw materials might be available, there are gaps in refining capacity (e.g., Polysilicon for solar panels).</li>

<li><b>Water Stress:</b> A critical spatial challenge is that nearly 75% of India's renewable energy capacity is clustered in water-stressed states, creating a conflict between energy generation and water conservation.</li>

<li><b>Infrastructure "Lock-in" Risk:</b> The NITI Aayog highlights that 86% of the building floor space that will exist in 2070 is yet to be built.</li>

<li>With Air Conditioner ownership projected to jump from 10% to over 80%, there is a massive risk of "locking in" high energy demand if passive design and super-efficient appliances are not mandated immediately.</li>

<li><b>Social & Regional Disparities:</b> The report identifies that over 150 districts are dependent on coal and thermal power ecosystems.</li>

<li>Fossil-fuel-linked manufacturing currently employs nearly 17 million workers.</li>

<li>These sectors face "profound restructuring pressures," requiring large-scale social protection and reskilling to prevent regional economic collapse.</li>

<li><b>Agriculture's Dual Vulnerability:</b> Agriculture is unique as it is both a source of emissions and a victim of climate change.</li>

<li>The challenge is to mitigate emissions (which are often "invisible") while ensuring food security for the largest employer in the country, without disrupting farmer livelihoods.</li>
